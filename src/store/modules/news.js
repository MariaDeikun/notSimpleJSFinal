            topic: 'Cororna',
            overview: 'The world is debating apps that prove you have been vaccinated. We are keeping track of what you really need to know.',
            full: 'A year ago, vaccines to tackle the covid pandemic still seemed like a far-off idea. Today, though, doses have been delivered to almost 40% of the world’s people—and some are being asked to prove they’re among them, leading to the rise of so-called vaccine passports. The details of these credentials vary from place to place, but at their heart they are the same: digital health records, stored on your phone, to use as proof that you are a low risk to others.  Supporters of digital vaccination credentials say the benefits are clear: they make congregating less risky while incentivizing vaccination. But critics see drawbacks and disadvantages. They say introducing restrictions infringes on civil liberties, unfairly punishes those who cannot get vaccinated (and discriminates against those who will not), unleashes another form of surveillance, and worsens inequalities rather than eradicating them.   Faced with this divergence of views, governments are taking very different approaches. In Europe, for example, seven countries launched a “digital green certificate” at the beginning of June, with another 21 nations due to join shortly. But some places are taking the opposite stance, strictly limiting the use of such documents or even banning their development altogether.  Along with these debates, there is still basic confusion about how systems would be used. Some, like the EU’s app, are for traveling between nations. Others, like New York State’s, are for getting into everyday places like restaurants and events. The term “passport” itself is becoming more ambiguous and more politically loaded: when California governor Gavin Newsom announced the launch of his state’s digital certificate, he specifically stated, “It’s not a passport; it’s not a requirement.”  We looked at the status of digital vaccine systems in all 50 states President Joe Biden has already said there won’t be a national app, leaving the choice to states. Some states have banned the apps outright as examples of government overreach. Often the debate over the technology seems like a proxy for a larger question: Should governments and businesses be allowed to require vaccination for covid?  A few key takeaways:  Most states have addressed the technology in some way, either in legislation or in comments from a lawmaker, a public health official, or the governor. 7 states have active vaccine certification apps, rising from 4 at our last count. 22 states have banned the systems to some degree, typically through executive orders. Most, though not all, of these states are Republican-led.'

Please take a deep breath. Scientists would really like you to understand that there’s no evidence delta has learned any new tricks, and these new names are for helping keep track of covid’s evolution—not nine new reasons to panic. And many researchers are also really, really hoping you’ll stop saying “delta plus.”  “The name ‘delta plus’ is completely incorrect, because it gives the perception that this will cause more damage,” says Anderson Brito, a member of the Pango Lineage Designation Committee, which assigns scientific names like B.1.1.7 to new branches of the virus. “So far, we have no evidence any of the mutations affect behavior compared to the original delta variant.”  It might be helpful to think of covid as a tree. Delta is like a thick branch on that tree—a big family of viruses that share a common ancestor and some of the same mutations, which let them spread between people more quickly. When the big branch grows new twigs, which happens all the time, scientists keep track by using technical names that include numbers and letters. But a new scientific name doesn’t mean those viruses will act any differently from the branch they grew from—and if one of those new branches does start to change its behavior, it gets a new Greek letter, not a “plus.”  (Now is a good time to note that while some of delta’s mutations make it more transmissible, vaccines are still very good at preventing severe illness from every known strain of covid.)'

            full: 'As covid-19 continues to evolve in the US, researchers are now developing the next generation of therapeutics, including a new approach that could help reduce the time it takes to recover from the disease.  While existing treatments include antivirals, antibodies, and steroids, scientists in the US and Europe are now focusing on creating decoys of the receptors the virus normally binds to, potentially neutralizing its harmful effects.  To develop the new therapy, scientists first had to engineer mice with a variant of the human protein known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2. This resides on the surface of cells and helps regulate phenomena such as healing, inflammation, and blood pressure.  Related Story  How to talk to vaccine-hesitant people Not all unvaccinated folks are anti-vaxxers. Kindness and non-judgmentalism will get you far when talking to them.  While ACE2 receptors can be found on cells all over the body, they are especially prevalent inside the lungs, heart, kidneys, and liver—organs the disease typically attacks.  To protect the real ACE2 receptors, here’s how the decoy does its job:  Usually, spike proteins on the virus’s surface act like keys to ACE2 receptors, opening up the doorway to infection. But the decoys, administered intravenously or through the nose depending on the stage of the disease, intercept the spike protein, leading it away from real receptors. After infection, the treatment could reduce the viral load inside the body, which might mean faster recovery times for patients.'

As part of this, we’ve been keeping track of digital contract tracing systems as they emerge around the world.  Now that many of these apps have moved from development to live deployment, we are sharing our tracking publicly. We hope this will provide a useful reference through offering a brief overview of decisions different countries are making in their efforts to contain the COVID-19 virus.  The tracker is not a definitive list and will be updated as COVID-19 technologies are deployed around the world.  Do leave comments on what you think we’re missing or other criteria we should be examining, either directly in the spreadsheet or by contacting researcher Elliot Jones, via email at: ejones@adalovelaceinstitute.org.  🔍You can find the tracker here (Google Sheet)    Below, we’ve summarised some of the trends we identified in July 2020 while first collating this spreadsheet and the questions we had about these systems going forward. Centralised or decentralised? Decentralised digital contact tracing apps, based on Google and Apple’s exposure notification framework API, have become the dominant paradigm across the world.  With the UK deciding to drop its in-development centralised contact tracing app in favour a decentralised app using Google and Apple’s framework, France now stands out as the only major European country pursuing its own system. Outside of Europe, new apps from countries like Japan and Canada to Saudi Arabia are using Google and Apple’s framework.  The greatest heterogeneity is in apps that were launched relatively early in the crisis, before Google and Apple released their framework, such as in Singapore, Australia or Iceland, and who have chosen to stick with their original systems.'

            full: 'Contact tracing apps, if fully compliant with EU rules and well-coordinated, can play a key role in all phases of crisis management. They can complement existing manual contact tracing and help interrupt the transmission chain of the virus. Thereby, they can contribute to saving lives.  Artificial intelligence The analytical power of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing are major assets when it comes to detecting patterns in the spread of the coronavirus. With their help, public health sectors can monitor the spread of the coronavirus and quickly devise effective response strategies.  In the healthcare industry, artificial intelligence also plays a part in powering the robots and other tools used when coming into contact with patients, as human interaction should be kept to a minimum.  Actions in response to the coronavirus pandemic: data, artificial intelligence and supercomputers   European supercomputers fighting the coronavirus Three powerful European supercomputing centres are engaged in studying and developing vaccines, treatments and diagnoses for the coronavirus.  By comparing digital models of the coronavirus’ proteins and matching them against a database of thousands of existing drugs, the aim is to discover which combinations of active molecules react to the virus. The supercomputers complement the classic trial and error clinical approach. A pharmaceutical company and several large biological and biochemical institutes participate by providing access to their databases of drugs. The Exscalate4CoV project, supported by €3 million in EU funding, is conducting research using an EU-backed supercomputing platform to check the potential impact of known molecules against the structure of the coronavirus.   In June, Exscalate4CoV announced that an already-registered generic drug used to treat osteoporosis, Raloxifene, could be an effective treatment for coronavirus patients with mildly symptomatic infection. The consortium is in discussion with the European Medicines Agency to advance to clinical trials, which, if successful, could make the drug available sooner.    On October 27, the Italian pharmaceutical regulatory agency, AIFA, has greenlighted a clinical trial for the use of Raloxifene in patients with mild symptoms caused by the coronavirus. The clinical study should validate the safety and efficiency of Raloxifene in blocking the replication of the virus in cells, and thus hold up the progression of the disease. In the initial phase, up to 450 participants in three separate treatment groups will be administered via a 7-day treatment of Raloxifene capsules in a randomised sample. Exscalate4CoV, using a unique combination of high performance computing power and AI with biological processing, screened 400,000 molecules and specifically tested 7,000 molecules in vitro.  Coronavirus response – data from space With its 30+satellites, the EU Space Programme, notably through its Earth Observation component, Copernicus, and its satellite navigation system, Galileo, offers free and open data/information that helps monitor and potentially mitigate against the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.   Since the beginning of the crisis, EU satellites have been monitoring traffic congestions at border crossings between Member States and mapping medical facilities, hospitals and other critical infrastructure. Data that is collected from satellites, in combination with artificial intelligence, provides public authorities at EU and national levels with models to better understand and tackle the emergency more efficiently.  The EU Space Programme offers solutions for multiple issues, such as:  safeguarding public health with Galileo - the most accurate positioning system in the world monitoring how we deliver on the Green Deal with Copernicus - the best Earth Observation system of its class ensuring a secure communication channel for Member States EU Space response to the coronavirus  On 5 June 2020, the European Commission launched the ‘Rapid Action Coronavirus Earth observation’ in collaboration with the European Space Agency. The Rapid Action tool relies on satellite data to measure the impact of the coronavirus lockdown and monitor post-lockdown recovery at local, regional and global levels. The data is then analysed using new digital tools, such as artificial intelligence.'
